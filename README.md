# Astrolab Frontend

Welcome to the **Astrolab** Frontend repository! This project is the graphical user interface (GUI) for **Astrolab**, a cross-platform database management tool built using **Wails** and **React** with **TypeScript**. The purpose of Astrolab is to simplify database management by providing an intuitive interface to view and edit databases from various sources.

## Features

- Cross-platform GUI (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- Built with **Wails** for native desktop experience
- **React** + **TypeScript** for the frontend development
- Support for multiple database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Database query editor
- Data viewing and editing capabilities
- Customizable and modern UI

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)
- **Go** (version 1.18 or higher)
- **Wails** (v2.x)

Install Wails globally if you haven't already:
